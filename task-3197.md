## Competencies
- Java SQL REST - should take care of all basic JAVA, SQL, database, and REST technologies, as well as testing, GIT, Agile, etc.
    - Might be missing multi-threading, hibernate, J2EE
- Spring Boot - should cover all things Spring and MVC pattern
- Web Development with Angular - should cover HTML, JS, and Angular, might be able to remove CSS
- For the technologies that we don't have explicit competencies for, there are 2 options:
    - For requirements like Hibernate and Multi-threading, we could include them in the Java SQL REST competency because they naturally fit in with the other topics
    - For requirements like EJB and Application Server, and other concepts that don't naturally fit in with an existing competency, we might have to make new competencies. The suggested modules and topics that could be covered are listed in [this](#unmapped-technologies) section.
---
## Miscellaneous Thoughts/Questions
- Could combine JSP with JSF in the same competency
- Multi-threading could go back in core Java?
- Hibernate in SQL/data? Or maybe in Spring when talking about Spring data?
- EJB and Application Server can be addressed in the same competency, maybe after Spring
- How in depth do they want PL/SQL? Is the Advanced SQL Module comprehensive enough?
